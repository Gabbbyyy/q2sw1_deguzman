			<td><p>The Samoyed is a medium-sized dog with a height ranging from 19 to 23 1/2 inches and weight from 50 to 65 pounds (23 to 29 kilograms). Samoyeds are squarely built, sturdy dogs, with a fluffy plumed tail curled over the back and draped to one side. The ears are prick and the head is broad.</p></td>

			<td><p>Many diseases and health conditions are genetic, meaning they are related to your pet’s breed. There is a general consensus among canine genetic researchers and veterinary practitioners that the conditions we’ve described herein have a significant rate of incidence and/or impact in this breed.That does not mean your dog will have these problems; it just means that she is more at risk than other dogs. We will describe the most common issues seen inSamoyedsto give you an idea of what may come up in her future. Of course, we can’t cover every possibility here, so always check with us if you notice any unusual signs or symptoms.</p></td>

			<td><p>The Samoyed is a friendly, personable dog. These are intelligent dogs, with a touch of independence. Bred to live in a tent in very close quarters with their families, they thrive on human company. Samoyeds will alarm bark and, if left alone for long periods of time, will often develop into nuisance barkers. Digging can be a problem because they dig to reach a cool resting place.</p></td>

			<td><p>The Samoyed enjoys daily exercise in the form of a long walk or hike coupled with vigorous games. It loves to run and explore, so it requires a safe area such as a securely fenced yard. The dog also enjoys sledding and other weight-pulling activities, and it can compete successfully in agility, obedience, and nose-work competitions. As a rule, Samoyeds are not eager swimmers.The breed is conditioned to cold weather, and its thick undercoat can cause overheating in warm climates. The undercoat is subject to severe matting if it is not brushed all the way down to the skin two to three times per week (and as often as daily during shedding seasons, the heaviest of which occurs in the spring). When serious matting does occur, the problem area may need to be professionally shaved from the body. As with other large dog breeds prone to hip dysplasia, Samoyed puppies should eat a large-breed puppy food designed to slow their growth rate, which reduces the chance of developing the disorder.</p></td>

			<td><p>The Samoyed is truly an ancient breed, selected by nomadic tribes in Siberia to herd their reindeer and double as sled pullers when needed. Originally, these all-purpose dogs were of a variety of colors, but the sparkling white has since taken over in most areas of the world. The Soviet Nenet Herding Laika may be the true ancestor of the Samoyed we know.</p></td>
